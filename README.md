# APPEAL APPLICATION

Under the General University Examination Regulation, a candidate is allowed
to appeal against examination results within one academic unit from the date of
publication of results. Much as it is the right of every candidate to appeal against
examination results, this web application developed to manage appeals against
examination results by following SOKOINE UNIVERSITY OF AGRICULTURE (SUA) procedures.
